__help__

This command generates a CSV from a given directory of fastq sample files. An [example](https://github.com/EIT-Pathogena/client/tree/__version__/docs/assets) of such a CSV file is given in the assets directory. A CSV file in this format is required to run the [pathogena upload](#pathogena-upload) command.


Note: the CSV file must be located in the same directory as the sample.fastq files to be used with the upload command.
